This is an overly simple 2x2 matrix multiplier that when given two 2x2 matrix it performs multiplication on them and returns the result.

## Future Improvements

As stated this is an overly simple calculator. Some improvements:

```
1.  Handle a variety of matrices i.e. 3x2, 3x3 e.t.c
2.  Change the Variable names so that they are understandable
```

## Running the code

### Prerequisites
```
1.  GCC Compiler / Visual C Compiler.
2.  Visual Studio (Optional).
```

### Actually Running the code

For Linux:
```
  gcc matrixV1.c -o matrixV1 && ./matrixV1
```

For Windows:

```
  gcc matrixV1.c -o matrixV1.exe && ./matrixV1.exe
```
If you are using Visual Studio just run the code normally as you would.

### Sample output
Given:

```
{ {1, 2}, {3, 4} } and { {5, 6}, {7, 8} }
```

```
The result of the matrix:
19 22 
43 50 
```
